1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic that we have covered in my domain this quarter was the topic of Semantic Smoothing. Semantic Smoothing is a way to defend LLMs from outputting objectionable content by randomly pertubating the input and aggregating the response to ensure that the LLM only outputs safe content.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project would be some other fast and efficient ways to increase the defense mechanisms of LLMs. While there are many simple ways, we want to specifically find some ways that are computationally innexpensive. 
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change that I would make to the approach taken in our Quarter 1 Project would be the choice of LLMs we are using. We started with ChatGPT because it was the most accessible, but I think it would be very cool to experiment with a couple other models and see how they differ.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Some other techniques that I would be interested in using in our project would be trying out different token-wise defense mechanisms. This would be interesting because they do not require the use of an external LLM to create the changes, and thus the computational cost would stay low.
